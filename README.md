Steps for running the code:
1. Install npm packages in the Backend folder through the terminal: npm i or npm i --legacy-peer-deps
2. Install npm packages in the Frontend folder through the terminal: npm I or npm i --legacy-peer-deps
3. Run the Backend server (inside Backend folder) through the terminal: npm start
4. After you see, "Socketio initialized", Run the Frontend server (inside Frontend folder) through new terminal: npm start
5. Change the URL from http://localhost:3000/register to http://localhost:3000/home . This will lead you to homepage of the project. 

You can skip Step 1 and 2 if you have installed the npm packages to the project initially (as npm packages needs to be installed to the project only once).
